# rlloop project with DQN

## Intro
Applying reinforcement learning algorithm to play [icegame](https://github.com/kvzhao/icegame), which is a physical problem designed as a Game.

## Enviroment
* python 2.7
* tensorflow 1.0
* need to install `gym-icegame enviroment` and put `libicegame.so` in this dir

## some setting
* action: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] (with auto_step)
* now use: double DQN

## Codes credits
* dqn code : https://github.com/dennybritz/reinforcement-learning/tree/master/DQN
